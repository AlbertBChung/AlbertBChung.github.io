						<h1>Side Projects</h1>
						<div class="work-entry">
								<h2>Collision Defense</h2>

							<p class="description">A 2D game in Java made in the summer of '16. The objective is to repel enemies from the player's base. The game was embedded onto HTML as a JApplet and hosted on a Apache Server on Linux. Used Javascript, PHP, and XML to obtain user's score, append it to XML file, and display top scoreboard of real players.</p>

						<div class="work-entry">
								<h2>Showerfy</h2>

							<p class="description">An Android application built with team of five during Cornell's BigRed//Hacks 36 hour Hackathon in the Autumn of '16. Used the Spotify SDK to build a music player app. The user's goal is to limit their shower duration (and thereby reduce water usage) to the duration of two selected songs. User is rewarded or penalized with in-app points based on time difference and can share results on social media. One of the 13 out of 79 teams that were selected by judges to demo on the main stage.</p>
